Tendermint provides a tutorial for getting started with built-in apps that run in the same process as Tendermint core (https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tutorials/go-built-in.html). The tutorial is slightly out of date (some of the import paths method signature have changed). This example works locally on a Mac (Intel).
